              Rodić Davidson: London Architecture
            </span>
            <p class="item__text">
              Our Bloomsbury based practice has been working in central London
              since 2006. Having worked within the oldest areas of London, we
              have developed an expertise in historic buildings. These are often
              Listed and situated within a Conservation Area. Our knowledge and
              experience consistently secure Planning Consents, Listed Building
              Consents and Great Estate Licenses. <br /><br />Many areas within
              central London boroughs were originally developed by aristocratic
              families (examples being Grosvenor, Cadogan, De Walden, Portman
              and Bedford), and these family estates still own large swathes of,
              what is now commonly referred to as, Prime Central London. These
              Great Estates maintain significant influence either through direct
              ownership or through various stewardship schemes, an example being
              the Belgrave Estate Management Scheme administered by Grosvenor.
              Schemes such as this enable the Estate to exert control over the
              use, development, and appearance of the designated area.
              <br /><br />We have a growing body of new-build work in Prime
              Central London and elsewhere in the UK. Through sensitive,
              contextual design and iterative dialogue with Clients and
              Planners, Rodić Davidson have established a track record of
              obtaining difficult planning consents for both new-build and
              existing properties.

            <p class="item__text"></p>
              We are Rodić Davidson, an award-winning architecture, design, and
              interiors studio with the belief that buildings are more than
              brick and mortar; they are an extension of ourselves and our
              environment. Our practice specializes in design-led and highly
              crafted renovations and new-builds. We pride ourselves on an
              ability to deliver thoughtful and imaginative design whilst
              safeguarding our clients’ commercial interests.<br /><br />
              We are and RIBA Chartered Practice based in Bloomsbury, central
              London. Whilst much of our work is local to us in London, the
              practice has an expanding portfolio of work across the UK;
              predominantly in the east and southeast of England but also
              including projects reaching as far as Scotland. We have experience
              working in rural locations, particularly in Norfolk, Suffolk, Kent
              and Sussex where we have undertaken a number of farmstead and
              country house projects, for both UK and overseas-based clients.
              These projects often involve sensitive restoration of listed
              buildings, usually with some more contemporary new-build
              additions. The practice seeks to develop sensitive yet ambitious
              design solutions that celebrate heritage while recognizing that
              buildings are often now required to perform different functions
              and should consume less carbon in doing so. In striving for lower
              carbon design solutions, we look to insulate well and integrate
              renewable technologies wherever possible.
